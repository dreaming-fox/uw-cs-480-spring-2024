# Stephen Hwang UW CS 480 Spring 2024 Final Project
Regression machine learning model to predict the real values of six target traits given a) a 128 x 128 image of a plant and b) 163 additional attributes associated with that plant.

Please note that:
- In order for the Jupyter file to run properly, the directory structure must be upheld
- Additional files/directories may be created upon runtime
- Due to space limitations, images have not been included in the dataset
